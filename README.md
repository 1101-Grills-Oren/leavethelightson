A little game i've been working on. If anybody actually installs and tests it, send me footage of the entire thing for each crash. This may become an actual game eventually...

# Details
If anybody wants to make art for the game, msg me at neroastern@gmail.com
The folder 'compiled' will contain executables, the folder 'versions' will contain the code for each version and a file listing the current version id. There will be another file stating the version of the folder containing blank platformer code in case anybody wants to make their own. However, if you use this code to make your own game, you MUST reference me, or else.

I will have a file containing changes such as bugfixes and added features. Any bugs in collision and things such as that should be reported on THIS Github repository, instead of any repositories that use this code. Any other bugs should be reported on the Github containing the buggy code.

If you want to help me code this game, just let me know, and I will try to setup a meeting.
